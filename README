= Shells Everywhere =

Everybody hates to hop between computers that doesn't have your favorite prompt and aliases ready when needed. At least I hate it. Therefore I have created this hobby project to have some kind of logical structure when setting up my work environments with minimal fuzz. And reinvent the wheel.

== Prerequisite ==

These process flows requires that you're entering your shell environment as a login shell. For example, in ubuntu terminal go edit -> Profile Preferences -> Title and Command -> check run command as a login shell.

== Architecture ==

Every shell environment is isolated to named folder in the project root (bash, ksh, etc). Every computer is listed as folder in env/ folder and inside them each distinct configurable component is separated to own .env file. Ideally I had mind that one could use only sh compatible script what would be runnable in every shell environment, but then I found that csh based shells are so different that it was easier to replicate the logic for both environments.
 
Next I will describe project structure. 

=== init ===

Scripts that are used to bootstrap shell environments to this project

=== rc ===
   
Files that are sourced on each start of a shell (global rc files).   

=== sbin ===

Utility scripts that are used by shell environment initializations.

=== <shell name> ===

Shell startup scripts and shell specific source files.

=== env ===

Common environment modules are placed can be placed in this folder. Host specific configurations are created as sub folders (folder name is "hostname -s").

==== <host> ====

Consist env-files which each consist self-consistent configuration of a component, such as java, maven, glassfish, etc.
